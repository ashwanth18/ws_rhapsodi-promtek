# Goal
string target_name
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped target_pose
# Optional multi-point path
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped[] waypoints
## New: list of names to resolve from targets.yaml and append as waypoints (in order)
## If both waypoint_names and waypoints are provided, waypoint_names are applied first,
## then literal waypoints are appended. Any unknown name aborts the goal with an error.
string[] waypoint_names
## New: per-goal speed scaling (clamped to [0,1]). If <= 0, node params are used.
float32 velocity_scaling
float32 acceleration_scaling
## Optional per-waypoint scaling (applies to sequential joint-space segments only).
## Length should match the final number of waypoints (names + literals). Missing/short arrays
## fall back to per-goal scaling. Ignored for Cartesian (single trajectory).
